# Restaurant-page

**Restaurant Page** A dynamic restaurant website built using vanilla JavaScript, ES6 modules, and Webpack to create a dynamic restaurant website where all content is generated via JavaScript. Instead of writing static HTML for each page/tab, modules are used to build and insert elements into the DOM on the fly.  

## Features  
- Navigation tabs (Home, Menu, About) implemented with buttons and JavaScript event listeners.  
- Content for each tab comes from its own module.  
- No page reloads when switching tabs — the DOM is manipulated dynamically.  
- Built using Webpack for bundling assets (JS, CSS, images).  
- Production build outputs into `dist/` directory (which is ignored by Git).

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)
